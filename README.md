This repository contains the datasets I have constructed for the paper "Nationalization of U.S. Local Elections", also found in this respository "nationalization-paper". 
Please cite this paper if any data is used from this repository.

"presvotes-bymuni.xlsx" contains U.S. presidential election returns from 2000-2020 by municipality. It is a close approximation of results (except for California that publishes results by municipality) using an algorithm that maps each voting precinct to its closest municipality according to longitude and lattitude coordinates. Please see paper for more details.

"mayoral-elections.xlsx" contains U.S. mayoral election returns from 1994-2022. This is built upon the dataset by Warshaw, de Benedictis-Kessner, and Velez (2022).
